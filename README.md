# Language Translator

## Description:
Translate English into Chinese, French, and Spanish. Created a dictionary with some words that can be used on a holiday gift card. When using those particular words, you are able to translate them into 3 other languages. If you type in a word that isn't already inside the dictionary, you will get an error.
